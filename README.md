# opencode-websearch-gemini

Gemini Web Search plugin for [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai), inspired by [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli).

This plugin exposes a Gemini-backed web search capability as an OpenCode custom tool, so your agent can call a single tool to perform Google-grounded web search.

---

## Features

- `websearch_gemini` tool backed by Google Gemini web search, uses the official `@google/genai` SDK under the hood.
- Always calls the `gemini-2.5-flash` model with the `googleSearch` tool enabled.
- Outputs results in the same format as Gemini CLI.

---

## How it works

- The plugin registers a custom tool named `websearch_gemini` with OpenCode.
- When an agent calls this tool with a `query`, the plugin:
  - Resolves a Gemini API key first from the OpenCode Google provider and then falls back to the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable.
  - Uses `@google/genai` to call a Gemini model configured with the `googleSearch` tool.
  - Takes the returned answer text and grounding metadata.
  - Inserts citation markers into the text and builds a sources list.
  - Returns a markdown-formatted answer plus a structured `sources` array.

This mirrors the behavior of the Gemini CLI `WebSearchTool`, but packaged as an OpenCode plugin.

From a user perspective:

- You ask your OpenCode agent a question that needs web context.
- The agent decides to call `websearch_gemini` with your natural-language query.
- Gemini performs a web search and returns an answer with inline citations and a numbered "Sources" list at the bottom.

## Installation

Add `opencode-websearch-gemini` to your `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "plugin": ["opencode-websearch-gemini@0.9.2"]
}
```

OpenCode does not upgrade plugins automatically, so you need to pin the version once the plugin upgraded.

As long as the plugin is enabled and the Gemini API key is configured, any OpenCode agent that can use tools will be able to call `websearch_gemini` when it needs web search.

## Setup Gemini API key

This plugin needs a Gemini API key and resolves it in this order:

1. **OpenCode auth store**: run `opencode auth login`, select the Google provider, and input your Gemini API key when prompted.
2. **Environment fallback**: if you prefer not to store the key, export it as `GEMINI_API_KEY`:

   ```bash
   export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-gemini-api-key"
   ```

If neither source is available, `websearch_gemini` returns a `MISSING_GEMINI_API_KEY` error to the agent.

### OAuth support

This plugin only supports **API key based authentication** for Gemini. If you are using [opencode-gemini-auth](https://github.com/jenslys/opencode-gemini-auth), re-authenticating with `opencode auth login` will overwrite your OAuth token, so use the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable instead.

---

## Development

This repository uses Bun and TypeScript.

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Run tests after any change
bun test
```

When testing the plugin against a globally installed `opencode` CLI during development, you can point OpenCode at a local checkout using a `file://` URL in your `opencode.jsonc`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "plugin": ["file:///path/to/opencode-websearch-gemini/index.ts"]
}
```

Contributions and feedback are welcome.
